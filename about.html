      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Mario Baroud</strong>. I am a pre-service
        Mathematics and Computing teacher currently studying a
        <em>Bachelor of Education (Secondary)</em> at the Australian Catholic University.
        I want to make mathematics engaging, approachable, and enjoyable for every student, no matter their ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my career by tutoring high school students in mathematics, which helped me discover my love for teaching. Since then, I have worked in classrooms at Marist College Kogarah and Marist Catholic College Penshurst through learning support and professional placements. These experiences shaped my teaching philosophy: students learn best when they feel valued, supported, and challenged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside the classroom, I run <strong>Baroud Education Tutoring</strong>,
        where I offer personalised maths tuition and lead group seminars for HSC students. This work lets me use classroom strategies in one-on-one settings and shows me that good teaching needs both subject knowledge and empathy, clear communication, and flexibility.
