        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Mario Baroud</strong> and I am a pre-service Mathematics and Computing Teacher.</p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--brand);">My Background</h3>
        <p>I am currently studying the <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/course/bachelor-of-education-secondary?campus=Blacktown&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21106975822&gbraid=0AAAAADjBE4Dss_20FhIUqnQn4ORuqi3Dy&gclid=CjwKCAjw2vTFBhAuEiwAFaScwtLgUFAdLWJl_oouMJe9OipVuYOkBYnQfh4dWFwr6c3yI-lS_5oSHBoCGmgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">
    Bachelor of Education (Secondary)
  </a> at ACU, specialising in Mathematics and Computing. At the start of 2023, I was studying a double degree in Software Engineering and Medical Science at UTS. However, after my experience as a tutor, I decided to switch career paths at the end of 2023 and become a Maths teacher! There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a student go from knowing 0% to 100% in a single lesson. </p>

        <p>I work as a Learning Support Officer to gain experience in classrooms, and I also run my own maths tutoring business, Baroud Education, to provide high school students with quality help from tutors who aced their maths HSC exams. I ranked <strong> First in the State in Maths Standard 2</strong> and <strong>First in Sydney Catholic Schools in Software Design and Development 2022</strong>. Because of this, I have been invited back to my old school as a tutor, as shown in the image on the right.</p>
