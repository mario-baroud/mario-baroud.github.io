            to build score. This project helped me practise movement, collision logic, and simple game loops.

        <h2>What These Projects Show</h2>

        <p>
          The UFO game was the first project I made that really seemed to come to life. I had to manage user input, game speed, collisions, and score logic all at the same time. This made me break a big challenge into smaller steps and solve each one. That process helped my teaching too, because it showed me how to break down complex tasks for students.
        </p>

        <p>
          I created the maths worksheets to address real issues I saw while tutoring. Many students struggled with similar questions, especially in HSC Mathematics Standard 2, so I wrote problem sets to help with those areas. I added worked examples and tips like “watch out for...” so students could use them for self-study. Making these resources taught me to explain ideas clearly and in different ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          The blackjack program stands out because it isn’t just about getting marks; it’s something I can show to students in Computing. It’s a clear example of using variables, conditionals, and state. I like using it to walk students through how the rules of a real game become code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, these three projects reflect both sides of what I want to do: teaching and building. They prove I can make helpful resources for students and also create working code. I want to keep growing in both areas as a Maths and Computing teacher.
