        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During my placement at Marist College Kogarah, I supported students in the
          <strong>Diverse Learning</strong> faculty. I worked with students who had diagnosed disabilities and extra learning needs, both in small groups and in mainstream classes. This experience showed me that differentiation, patience, and communication are not just strategies, but attitudes that help make learning accessible for everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned that small adjustments, such as breaking tasks into steps, using visuals, or checking in more often, can make a big difference to student engagement and confidence. Working with learning support staff and classroom teachers showed me how important teamwork is for inclusion. This placement also reminded me that success looks different for each student, and progress should be measured by individual growth, not by comparison.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Marist Catholic College Penshurst, I developed these skills further while teaching Mathematics to Stage 4 students (Years 7 and 8). I focused on improving my questioning techniques and making lessons clearer. I tried to predict where students might struggle and changed my explanations before confusion set in. This placement showed me that good teaching means balancing preparation, observation, and responsiveness, and being ready to adapt as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, both placements helped me see that inclusive education is not separate from teaching; it is teaching. Every classroom has diverse learners, and my job is to create an environment where each student feels supported, capable, and valued.
