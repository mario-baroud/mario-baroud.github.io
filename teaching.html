        <h2>My Core Beliefs</h2>
        <p>
          For me, teaching is more than just sharing knowledge. It is about helping students become confident and curious thinkers. I believe every student should feel heard and motivated to take charge of their own learning. I work to build real relationships so students feel safe to take risks and make mistakes, since that is when real growth happens.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think effective teaching starts with understanding each student’s background, interests, and goals. I try to adjust my lessons so every student, no matter their ability, can connect with mathematical ideas. Collaboration, reflection, and helpful feedback are key parts of my teaching. I use them to help students turn content into real understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a teacher, I see myself as a lifelong learner. I stay open to feedback, use new technology, and keep improving my teaching methods so I can stay current and meet students’ needs. My teaching is based on empathy, consistency, and clarity. These are the same values I want my students to develop.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adjust teaching methods to support different learning needs.</li>
          <li>Encourage a growth mindset and resilience by giving helpful feedback.</li>
          <li>Design lessons that connect math to real-life situations.</li>
          <li>Build a classroom where respect, teamwork, and curiosity are encouraged.</li>
        </ul>
